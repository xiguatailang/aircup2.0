    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        I am a grassroot entrepreneur from an ordinary family with no resources. The only thing I have is industrial experience. <br />When I entered this industry with 400,000 yuan raised by my family members, I was ridiculed and questioned by many people. They even sentenced me to fail before I started it.<br /><br />“You don’t know algorithms. You have no supply chains. How dare you?”<br />“Such project is for MTI or Stanford geniuses.”<br />“I graduated from Special Class for the Gifted Young in University of Science and Technology of China, and now work in a research institute, but I dare not do it.”<br />“You know nothing about the difficulties in developing hardware.”<br /><br />Should I follow my dream, or just let it go? It was a tough choice. I suffered many sleepless nights. <br />Finally, I told myself I should try it. <br />The worst result was failure, but I only got one life where death was the inevitable destination. <br />To do or not to do, to succeed or not to succeed, I would end in death either way.<br /><br />Those who doubt me predict my end with their limited experience.<br />But my persistence comes from the enjoyment of creation. I enjoy it every day.<br />As for the results, only God knows.

    <p class="f_48">I started from the hardware</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        At the beginning of 2017, I quit job and started my business. I prepared myself for the entrepreneurship first. <br />I bought books, read papers, learnt relevant technologies and how to use equipment, such as 3D printer, laser cutting machine, and CNC machine, etc.<br />Those preparations built on my confidence and were of great help for my later work.<br />Then, I was faced with the critical choice. To do hardware or application?<br />Applications are castles in the air without hardware, so I began my road on hardware.

    <p class="story_b_p1">What is the first step in making smart glasses?</p>
    <p class="story_b_p2">What’s the difference between smart glasses and equipment like phone?<br />The design of optical path.<br />Let’s begin here.</p>
</div>
<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">Start with projecting an image in air.</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        Easy to say but hard to do. How could I project an image in the air? <br />I had no idea at all, but I had that impulse to make things. I searched for information and principles of simple projector on the internet. <br />It was never too early to start, so I put other concerns behind and began my design.<br />
        My initial product was crude and the image was poor, but I got the most important feedback: I can do it.</p>

</div>
<div class="mar p_80">
    <p class="f_48">The principle of projecting images in air is learnt from HoloKit</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        Back then, smart glasses were not as many as today, so there were few actual products to study. Besides, I was a beginner and found most books had no clear explanation about the principle of projecting images, so I could not follow the principle in practice. <br /> But luckily, I got one Holokit in an activity hold by NetEase. <br />I studied it and learnt its principle of projecting images.

<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">Imitating HoloKit’s design to create my own AR box, but went through countless failures</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">Later I began to design AR box, and bought various AR lenses and Fresnel lenses.<br />Design-Proof-Failure, I tried dozens of times but achieved no progress.</p>
    <img src="{{ URL::asset('/') }}image/web/story_17_5.png" alt="" class="story_17_5 mar m_t40">
    <p class="bz">AR box: an optical system that wears on head with embedded mobile phone as light source.</p>

<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top: 330px">Things that seem easy to make are never easy to achieve.<br />The final products are results of countless failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">Finally, there is an image. God helps those who help themselves.</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">The image appeared after dozens of failures. I was thrilled, and I made another step forward.</p>
    <img src="{{ URL::asset('/') }}image/web/story_17_6.png" alt="" class="story_17_6 mar m_t40">
</div>
<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top: 410px">The shape of AR box was too simple, so we used LCD screen to replace phone as the display unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">I got the screen, and problems stalked behind.</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">I was not familiar with electronic components at first, but there was no other way other than marched forward.<br />When I got the screen, I encountered some problems. I contacted the agent, and ruled out problems one by one. I fixed it in the end.</p>

    <p class="f_48">A new generation of prototype</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        The product came out. I was excited and invited colleagues in our incubator to experience it.<br />“Lao Zheng, from a novice to a designer, you are great.”<br />The encouragement was like warm spring breeze comforting my heart.</p>

<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top:360px;">We need a portable computer</p>
    <p class="story_b_p2">We got rid of phone and used the screen as light source,<br />but screen relied on data and electricity from immovable PC.</p>
</div>
<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">Then, let’s build a host.</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">I was not able to build one from scratch. I modified the existing platform. A new power management module was needed, so I had to learn it. <br />How challenge each step was!</p>

</div>
<div class="mar p_80">
    <p class="f_48">Meanwhile, I learnt SLAM technology.</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        Technically, smart glasses consist of three parts, SLAM, calculation and display.<br />It involves 5 disciplines: optics, electronics, machinery, software, and algorithm. <br />I major in none of them, but I have a strong interest in all. I like to research everything relevant to products.
    </p>
    <img src="{{ URL::asset('/') }}image/web/story_17_10.png" alt="" class="story_17_10 mar m_t40">
    <p class="bz">SLAM refers to simultaneous localization and mapping. <br />Simply put, it means the position of the camera, and the distance between each surrounding object and the camera.

<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top:260px;">One tree does not make a forest.</p>
    <p class="story_b_p2">
        One person cannot handle the interdisciplinary new field. <br />There are numerous things to learn, so one must have a team.<br /><br />I met 2 or 3 persons every week, and travelled all over Beijing to search talents.<br />I learnt from them or invited them to join me. Excellent talents are always scarce.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">An optical master joined my team, and we started to develop our AR lenses.</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">After 8-month lonely journey, I finally found an optical master for my team. <br />We started to develop our AR lenses, and got better image quality.</p>

</div>
<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top:380px;">After one-year endeavor, we had tested several aspects, <br />and it was time to build a full function prototype.</p>
</div>
<div class="mar p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_48">Finished, our first full function prototype</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">Five days before the Spring Festival, we assembled our first full function prototype.<br />The functions include display, voice, depth camera and portable computer.</p>
    <img src="{{ URL::asset('/') }}image/web/story_17_13.png" alt="" class="story_17_13 mar m_t40">
    <p class="bz">Depth camera: It uses cameras and other sensors to sense the physical space distance.<br />It can detect the distance between each object and the camera.</p>

<div class="mar p_80">
    <p class="f_48">The initial outlook of our first-generation product</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">We improved it during the Spring Festival, and on 28 January, we updated it.</p>

    <p class="f_48">2017 Year in Review</p>
    <p class="f_24 m_t20">
        It is a year of transformation. From an AR box at the beginning of 2017 to a full function prototype at the end, <br />we experienced the whole procedure of designing smart glasses. <br />We know we still lag behind industrial leaders, but we are determined to persist with our choice and continue our road.</p>
