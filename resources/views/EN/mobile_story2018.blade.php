    <p class="f_60">To save the rent, I moved our office to my house.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">At the beginning of 2018, our lease contract with Chuang’ke Incubator run out. <br/>I moved our office to my house, so we could save near 1,000 yuan per month.</p>

    <p class="f_60">Around the Spring Festival, we launched the R & D for the second prototype.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">We had a new optical scheme. The key to minimizing the size was to find an appropriate screen.<br/>I found one 2.6-inch AUO screen, but I could not buy a sample. <br/>That screen was rarely sold in China. <br/>I was nobody, and didn’t need a large quantity of it,<br/>so agents were not cooperative.<br/>Agent’s cooperation was important for making hardware.</p>

    <p class="f_30 m_t20">My baby was to born, and it was not appropriate to use the house as office. <br/>I borrowed a tiny dormitory with no window.<br/>The room was quiet and could help people focus, <br/>but those who were fragile would collapse in such environment. <br/>I joked that one day inside, a week had passed outside. <br/>That’s why I named it “House of Spiritual Time”.</p>

    <p class="f_60">Poor working condition. <br/>The office was hotter than the outside.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">The office had no ventilation, so it was hotter inside. When the outside was 82.4°F, the inside was 86 °F. <br/>Every day after work, our body were sweaty and sticky. <br/>The office was humid and hot, and we got dozens of mosquitos’ sting every day.<br/>Later, we bought an AC, but the wire caught fire the moment our AC turned on.<br/>The house lines were too old to power an AC.<br/>We had to work over 10 hours in this poor condition.<br/>The hardships of entrepreneurship were more than mere words.</p>

I know we don’t have enough money to raise my salary, so I am thinking maybe I should quit now.”<br/>Therefore, our team returned to two persons. <br/>My conditions were bad, but I saw my counterparts were thriving, which disappointed me.<br/>I didn’t know how long I should hang on like that,<br/>and I even thought about giving up.</p>

I should quit.”<br/>“Hang on for another while.” <br/>We solved the tricky problem finally.</p>

    <p class="story_b_p2">It was autumn of 2018, and two things provoked my reflection.<br/>The first, on the second round of Good Design, our host failed to turn on, <br/> so we didn’t make it to the final round. We were not sure whether it was the instability that caused the failure.<br/><br/>The second, we also attended a bidding competition of smart head-mounted display held by the army. <br/>We won the second prize, but our products were dwarfed by others.<br/><br/>From the two setbacks, I realized that making products were anything but easy.<br/>What was my direction?<br/>What was my first intention?<br/>Did I want to wander around with no aim, or directly run to my goal?</p>
</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">Going back to our first intention.<br/>The greatest joy is from users’ satisfaction.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">Failures let us see the reality. We had focused on making prototype and learning technology, <br/>but didn’t think about how to use it, our target users,<br/>and where it would be used.<br/>After that, I pondered over those questions, <br/>and realized that simplicity was the bridge for users’ needs and solution to our problems. <br/>The finding was no new, but definitely true. <br/>The ideal shape of a pair of smart glasses should resemble a common pair of glasses.</p>
