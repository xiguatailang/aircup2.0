    </p>
    <p class="privacy_p1">We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation chat rooms and bulletin boards (“interactive services”).<br/>
        Where we do provide any interactive service, Aircup will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).</p>
    <p class="privacy_p1">We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and Aircup will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, Aircup is under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service Aircup provides on our site, and Aircup expressly excludes our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of Aircup’s content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
    </p>
    <p class="privacy_p1">Our products and services are not directed to children and you may not use our products and services if you are under the age of 13. We advise parents or guardians who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool-proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware by their parents or guardians of the potential risks to them.<br/>
        Where Aircup does moderate an interactive service, Aircup will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>
    <p class="privacy_p1">These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site (“contributions”), and to any interactive services associated with it.
