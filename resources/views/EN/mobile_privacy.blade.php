    and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
    security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

    response.</p>
<p class="privacy_p1">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take
    Aircup longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In
    this case, Aircup will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
