    <p class="qianyan">Foreword</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">I am a grassroot entrepreneur from an ordinary family with no resources.<br/>The only thing I have is industrial experience. <br/>When I entered this industry with 400,000 yuan raised by my family members, <br/>I was ridiculed and questioned by many people. <br/>They even sentenced me to fail before I started it.<br/><br/>“You don’t know algorithms. You have no supply chains. How dare you?”<br/>“Such project is for MTI or Stanford geniuses.”<br/>“I graduated from Special Class for the Gifted Young,and now work in a research institute, but I dare not do it.”<br/>“You know nothing about the difficulties in developing hardware.”<br/><br/>Should I follow my dream, or just let it go? <br/>It was a tough choice. I suffered many sleepless nights. <br/>Finally, I told myself I should try it. The worst result was failure, <br/>but I only got one life where death was the inevitable destination. <br/>To do or not to do, to succeed or not to succeed, I would end in death either way.<br/><br/>Those who doubt me predict my end with their limited experience.<br/>But my persistence comes from the enjoyment of creation.<br/>I enjoy it every day.<br/>As for the results, only God knows.</p>
</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80">
    <p class="f_60">I started from the hardware</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">At the beginning of 2017, I quit job and started my business. <br/>I prepared myself for the entrepreneurship first. <br/>I bought books, read papers, learnt relevant technologies and how to use equipment, such as 3D printer, laser cutting machine, and CNC machine, etc. <br/>Those preparations built on my confidence and were of great help for my later work. <br/>Then, I was faced with the critical choice. To do hardware or application?<br/>Applications are castles in the air without hardware,<br/>so I began my road on hardware.</p>

    <p class="story_b_p1">What is the first step in making smart glasses?</p>
    <p class="story_b_p2">What’s the difference between smart glasses and equipment like phone?<br/>The design of optical path.<br/>Let’s begin here.</p>
</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">Start with projecting an image in air.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">Easy to say but hard to do. <br/>How could I project an image in the air? I had no idea at all, <br/>but I had that impulse to make things.<br/>I searched for information and principles of simple projector on the internet.<br/>It was never too early to start, so I put other concerns behind and began my design. <br/>My initial product was crude and the image was poor,<br/>but I got the most important feedback: I can do it.</p>

</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80">
    <p class="f_60">The principle of projecting images in air is learnt from HoloKit</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">Back then, smart glasses were not as many as today, so there were few actual products to study. <br/>Besides, I was a beginner and found most books had no clear explanation about the principle of projecting images, <br/>so I could not follow the principle in practice. <br/>But luckily, I got one Holokit in an activity hold by NetEase. <br/>I studied it and learnt its principle of projecting images.</p>

<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">Imitating HoloKit’s design to create my own AR box, <br/>but went through countless failures</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">Later I began to design AR box, <br/>and bought various AR lenses and Fresnel lenses.<br/>Design-Proof-Failure, I tried dozens of times but achieved no progress.</p>

    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top: 3.3rem">Things that seem easy to make are never easy to achieve.<br/>The final products are results of countless failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">Finally, there is an image. <br/>God helps those who help themselves.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">The image appeared after dozens of failures. <br/>I was thrilled, and I made another step forward.</p>

</div>
<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top: 3.8rem">The shape of AR box was too simple,<br/>so we used LCD screen to replace phone as the display unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">I got the screen,<br/>and problems stalked behind.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">I was not familiar with electronic components at first, <br/>but there was no other way other than marched forward. <br/>When I got the screen, I encountered some problems. <br/>I contacted the agent, and ruled out problems one by one. I fixed it in the end.</p>

    <p class="f_60">A new generation of prototype</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">The product came out. I was excited and invited colleagues in our incubator to experience it.<br/>“Lao Zheng, from a novice to a designer, you are great.”<br/>The encouragement was like warm spring breeze comforting my heart.</p>

    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top:3.6rem;">We need a portable computer</p>
    <p class="story_b_p2">We got rid of phone and used the screen as light source, <br/>but screen relied on data and electricity from immovable PC.</p>

<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">Then, let’s build a host.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">I was not able to build one from scratch. I modified the existing platform. <br/>A new power management module was needed, so I had to learn it.<br/>How challenge each step was!</p>

<div class="w_720 p_80">
    <p class="f_60">Meanwhile, I learnt SLAM technology.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">Technically, smart glasses consist of three parts,<br/>SLAM, calculation and display.<br/>It involves 5 disciplines: optics, electronics, machinery, software, and algorithm. <br/>I major in none of them, but I have a strong interest in all.<br/>I like to research everything relevant to products.</p>
    <img src="{{ URL::asset('/') }}image/mobile_story_17_10.png" alt="" class="story_17_10 mar m_t40">
    <p class="bz">SLAM refers to simultaneous localization and mapping. <br/>Simply put, it means the position of the camera, and the distance between each surrounding object and the camera.</p>

<div class="story_b mar">
    <p class="story_b_p1" style="padding-top:2.2rem;">One tree does not make a forest.</p>
    <p class="story_b_p2">One person cannot handle the interdisciplinary new field. <br/>There are numerous things to learn, so one must have a team.<br/><br/>I met 2 or 3 persons every week, and travelled all over Beijing to search talents. <br/>I learnt from them or invited them to join me. <br/>Excellent talents are always scarce.</p>
</div>
<div class="w_720 p_80 bg_f7">
    <p class="f_60">An optical master joined my team, <br/>and we started to develop our AR lenses.</p>
    <p class="f_30 m_t20">After 8-month lonely journey,<br/>I finally found an optical master for my team. <br/>We started to develop our AR lenses, and got better image quality.</p>

    <p class="story_b_p1">After one-year endeavor, <br/>we had tested several aspects,<br/>and it was time to build a full function prototype.</p>

    <p class="f_30 m_t20">Five days before the Spring Festival, <br/>we assembled our first full function prototype.<br/>The functions include display, voice, depth camera and portable computer.</p>

    <p class="f_30 m_t20">It is a year of transformation. <br/>From an AR box at the beginning of 2017 to a full function prototype at the end, <br/> we experienced the whole procedure of designing smart glasses. <br/>We know we still lag behind industrial leaders,<br/>but we are determined to persist with our choice and continue our road.</p>
