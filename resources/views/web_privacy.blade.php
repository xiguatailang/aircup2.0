        response.</p>
    <p class="privacy_p1">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take
        Aircup longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In
        this case, Aircup will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
